## Genesis Block -- The starting block of a blockchain. 
- It does not have a previous block so no previous hash.

## Hashing 
- A hashing algorithms must have the following properties
    - It must be **Deterministic**
    - It must be **One-way**
    - It must be **Fast**
    - It must **Withstand artificial collisions**
    - It must be **resistant to changes in the input data -- Avalache effect**

### SHA256 -- It takes any file or value and always produce a fixed length hash of length 256bits i.e. 64 hex-characters.
